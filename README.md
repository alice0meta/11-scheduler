run `git clone https://github.com/alice0meta/11-scheduler.git` to download this program, and then `git pull` to fetch updates

make sure a key.txt file exists with contents being a mailgun key

except for the `git clone` all commands and files should be run and put in the same directory as this file

download https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16dpChQUSnZCl64ROTNHv7ToUD1ITxyZ4JE3em6EsBeg as .csv and rename it to users.csv

now you can send an email to a pair of users with like `send "Alice Bob" "Foo Bar" 2014-09-02T07:11Z`
