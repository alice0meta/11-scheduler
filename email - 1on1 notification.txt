Hey {a.firstname} and {b.firstname}!
 
I've partnered the two of you for this week's Skype chat, with tentative date and time of {time.format(full)}. If this doesn't work for either of you, you can reschedule on your own.
 
{a.firstname}{a.skype? "'s Skype username is {a.skype}" : " has no known Skype"}.
{a.knows && "They're knowledgeable about: {a.knows}"}
{a.wants && "They're interested in learning more about: {a.wants}"}
 
{b.firstname}{b.skype? "'s Skype username is {b.skype}" : " has no known Skype"}.
{b.knows && "They're knowledgeable about: {b.knows}"}
{b.wants && "They're interested in learning more about: {b.wants}"}

If you don't already use Skype lots, https://talky.io/ is a really nice and painless videochat webapp.
 
Enjoy!
